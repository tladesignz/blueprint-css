This is a CSS framework designed to cut down on your CSS development time. It gives you a solid foundation to build your own CSS on. Here are some of the features BP provides out-of-the-box:\r\n\r\n* An easily customizable grid\r\n* Sensible default typography\r\n* A typographic baseline\r\n* Perfected browser CSS reset\r\n* A stylesheet for printing\r\n* Powerful scripts for customization\r\n* Absolutely no bloat!\r\n\r\n## Project Info\r\n\r\n* *Web*: \"http://blueprintcss.org\":http://blueprintcss.org\r\n* *Source*: \"http://github.com/joshuaclayton/blueprint-css\":http://github.com/joshuaclayton/blueprint-css\r\n* *Wiki*: \"http://github.com/joshuaclayton/blueprint-css/wikis/home\":http://github.com/joshuaclayton/blueprint-css/wikis/home\r\n* *Bug/Feature Tracking*: \"http://blueprintcss.lighthouseapp.com\":http://blueprintcss.lighthouseapp.com\r\n\r\n## Setup Instructions\r\n\r\nHere's how you set up Blueprint on your site.\r\n\r\n* Upload the \"blueprint\" folder in this folder to your server, and place it in whatever folder you'd like. A good choice would be your CSS folder.\r\n* Add the following three lines to every @<head/>@ of your site. Make sure the three @href@ paths are\r\n* correct (here, BP is in my CSS folder):\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"css/blueprint/screen.css\" type=\"text/css\" media=\"screen, projection\">\r\n<link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"css/blueprint/print.css\" type=\"text/css\" media=\"print\">\r\n<!--[if lt IE 8]>\r\n  <link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"css/blueprint/ie.css\" type=\"text/css\" media=\"screen, projection\">\r\n<![endif]-->\r\n```\r\n\r\n* Remember to include trailing slashes (\" />\") in these lines if you're using XHTML.\r\n* For development, add the .showgrid class to any container or column to see the underlying grid. Check out the @plugins@ directory for more advanced functionality.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Tutorials\r\n\r\n* \"How to customize BP with the compressor script\":http://jdclayton.com/blueprints_compress_a_walkthrough.html\r\n* \"How to use a grid in a layout\":http://subtraction.com/2007/03/18/oh-yeeaahh\r\n* \"How to use a baseline in your typography\":http://alistapart.com/articles/settingtypeontheweb\r\n\r\n## Files in Blueprint\r\n\r\nThe framework has a few files you should check out. Every file in the @src@ directory contains lots of (hopefully) clarifying comments.\r\n\r\nCompressed files (these go in the HTML):\r\n\r\n* @blueprint/screen.css@\r\n* @blueprint/print.css@\r\n* @blueprint/ie.css@\r\n\r\nSource files:\r\n* @blueprint/src/reset.css@<br/>\r\nThis file resets CSS values that browsers tend to set for you.\r\n* @blueprint/src/grid.css@<br/>\r\nThis file sets up the grid (it's true). It has a lot of classes you apply to @<div/>@ elements to set up any sort of column-based grid.\r\n* @blueprint/lib/blueprint/grid.css.erb@<br/>\r\nThis file is used by the compressor (see below) when generating grids. All changes to grid.css are mirrored in this file, manually. \r\n* @blueprint/src/typography.css@<br/>\r\nThis file sets some default typography. It also has a few methods for some really fancy stuff to do with your text.\r\n* @blueprint/src/forms.css@<br/>\r\nIncludes some minimal styling of forms.\r\n* @blueprint/src/print.css@<br/>\r\nThis file sets some default print rules, so that printed versions of your site looks better than they usually would. It should be included on every page.\r\n* @blueprint/src/ie.css@<br/>\r\nIncludes every hack for our beloved IE6 and 7.\r\n\r\nScripts:\r\n* @lib/compress.rb@<br/>\r\nA Ruby script for compressing and customizing your CSS. Set a custom namespace, column count, widths, output paths, multiple projects, and semantic class names. See commenting in @compress.rb@ or run @$ruby compress.rb -h@ for more information.\r\n* @lib/validate.rb@<br/>\r\nValidates the Blueprint core files with the W3C CSS validator.\r\n\r\nOther:\r\n* @blueprint/plugins/@<br/>\r\nContains additional functionality in the form of simple plugins for Blueprint. See individual readme files in the directory of each plugin for further instructions.\r\n* @tests/@<br/>\r\nContains html files which tests most aspects of Blueprint. Open @tests/index.html@ for further instructions.\r\n\r\n## Extra Information\r\n\r\n* For credits and origins, see AUTHORS.\r\n* For license instructions, see LICENSE.\r\n* For the latest updates, see CHANGELOG.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
